# Practice_Form_Selenide_Automation
Stack: Java, JUnit5, Gradle, Selenide

Task: Develop one autotest for validation forms https://demoqa.com/automation-practice-form.

Conditions and purpose: We do not develop layers and do not flexibly pass data through methods for reuse. 
This is aimed at developing quick tests and checks where we use the power of Selenide, as well as demonstrating the ability to create clear 
and readable CSS / Xpath selectors. Immediately write working code with data entry and field checks. 
This is a short practice without the need to demonstrate knowledge of patterns and so on.
